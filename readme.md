**I would like all of yuo guys to go to both of these links:**

- [Concurrent React](https://rethinking-reactivity.surge.sh/#slide=24)

- [The Svelte Alternative](https://rethinking-reactivity.surge.sh/#slide=25)

These are from the slides of Rich Harris `Creater of Svelte`

**How To Speed Up Our Code**

- [ ] Break it into small chunks and move it around
- [ ] Put it in a web worker
- [ ] Rewrite it in Rust
- [x] Get rid of it


**How it deals with styles**
- Real world example _the website we are working on_
- Parent Component's styles in Svelte doesn't affect child component's styles
- Tells us about unused styles and removes it from the compiled app
